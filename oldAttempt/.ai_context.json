    "task": "Update the html output to be both inline and formatted correctly; ensure docs.html renders native HTML content safely and use a JSON script tag to store pages instead of embedding large JS strings. Fix CSS braces and ensure JS parsing of pages works.",
    "project_state": "docs.html repaired and improved: CSS fixed, pages embedded as JSON in <script id=\"rtfm-data\">, parse via JSON.parse. Added toolbar toggles (MD, Sanitize, Fuzzy), persisted config to localStorage, default sanitize = true. Added generate_docs.py to regenerate docs.html from a docs/ directory or input JSON. Added README.md describing usage and security. Added basic GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/validate.yml to validate embedded JSON. Created docs/ directory with main.md and server.md sample pages. Use python3 for scripts. Current tasks/ideas: - Optionally enable sanitize by default (done) or make it configurable at build time. - Add Makefile or CLI wrapper to generate docs.html as part of CI. - Add sample docs/ content and demonstrate generate_docs usage (done). - Add accessibility improvements, lazy-loading for large datasets, and CI HTML validation. Next actions to consider: add generate_docs invocation in a Makefile, add more sample pages, add unit/HTML validation steps, or change config defaults. "
